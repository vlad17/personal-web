# Jupyter Tricks

Here's a list of my top-used Juypter tricks, and what they do.

## UI

I find the UI to be intuitive, `Help > User Interface Tour` describes more. There are **command** (enter by pressing the escape button or clicking outside of a cell) and **edit** (enter by typing in a cell) modes. You can tell you're in edit mode if the "pencil" corner indicator is present:

It's also faster to use the commands as listed in `Help > Keyboard Shortcuts`; with those you can also remove the toolbar with `View > Toggle Toolbar`.

`jupyter notebook existing-notebook.ipynb` - auto-launch an existing notebook without the Jupyter menu.

## Remote Serving

Run the kernel on a beefy server, view with a browser on your laptop. You can change the ports appropriately to something high and unused.

1. On laptop, initiate SSH with a tunnel `ssh -L8888:localhost:12321 vlad@my-beefy-server.com`
1. On server, launch `tmux` if you'd like to persist the Jupyter server (useful if you need to keep running stuff and reconnect notebook later).
1. On server, `jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=12321`
1. On laptop, navigate to `localhost:8888` in-browser.

## TeX

The way I use TeX in Jupyter notebook depends on the end goal of the notebook itself. 

* [Embedded (Math) TeX](#embedded-latex). Here, the end product is ***.ipynb notebook itself**, in which case the _TeX is auxiliary to the code_, placed only to elucidate the math involved.
* [Jupyter-prepared Reports](#jupyter-prepared-reports). Here, the end product is a prepared ***.pdf report**, in which case the _code is auxiliary to the TeX_, with Jupyter used to create the source code for a more formal report or document, one you would print out.

In both of the above use cases, one may find it useful to generate rendered [TeX from code](#tex-from-code)

### Embedded TeX

Use MathJax in Markdown cells. In the first equation you can add convenience `\newcommand` items if you prefer (MathJax will evaluate cells top down).

_Note:_ The magic `%%latex` works, but I don't use it. It's treated like a code cell, but we're really only interested in the output in this setting. Finally, you can embed images right in the Markdown, too, with `<img src="path/to/image.png">`.

### Jupyter-prepared Reports

In this setting, use raw input cells to create segments of `LaTeX` code. This won't render within the notebook, but this is OK since we're treating the notebook like source in this setting. To generate a report (with the inline evaluated code), I use `nbconvert`. For prepared scripts, check out [my ipython-latex repo](https://github.com/vlad17/ipython-latex).

### TeX from Code

## Logging

Bring logging to the cell output:

```{python}
import logging
logging.getLogger().addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())
logging.getLogger(some_module.that.I.want.logged).setLevel(logging.INFO)
```

## Matplotlib

```{python}
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.rc('font', family='serif', serif='Computer Modern Roman')
plt.rc('text', usetex=True)
```

This preamble will render generated Matplotlib objects in the Jupyter HTML. The font specified above is consistent with the LaTeX generated by ipython-latex in Jupyter-prepared reports. Notably, this is going to differ from the MathJax font that is used inside Markdown cells.
    
## Magic

Docs accessible with `%<magic>?`.

* `x = !! echo hi` - run a bash command in a subshell, save stdout in returned string, split on newlines (`!` for no split)
* `%%bash` - run cell as bash 
* `%%timeit` - time cell 
* `? f` - get docstring 
* `?? f` - get source
* `%run nb.ipynb` - line magic, runs notebook 
* `%pdb` - run debbuger on cell evaluation 
* `%env ENV_VAR=3` - set enviornment variable in kernel
* [Cell code profiling](http://arogozhnikov.github.io/2016/09/10/jupyter-features.html#Profiling:-%prun,-%lprun,-%mprun).

## Extensions

These are the extensions I find useful: auto-format code, toggle font size, auto-comment regions, spell check, and control the cutoff at which output starts scrolling, respectively, below.

```
conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
pip install yapf # for code-prettification
for i in hide_input/main code_prettify/code_prettify code_font_size/code_font_size comment-uncomment/main spellchecker/main autoscroll/main; do jupyter nbextension enable $i ; done
```
