Hello! After graduating from Princeton with a degree in Computer Science, I became an EECS Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley at the [RISELab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/). I dropped out to work at a startup, [Sisu](http://sisu.ai), where I was Head of ML. At Google, I worked in Google Research in [Cerebra](https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-340-social-intelligence-with-blaise-aguera-y-arcas/), and now I'm at Google DeepMind.

If you find any typos or incorrect information, I would really appreciate it if you let me know! Please fill in a [GitHub issue form](https://github.com/vlad17/vlad17.github.io/issues/new).

If you want to contact me for some other reason, or don't have a GitHub account, then you can email me. It's my full first name (Vlad is short for Vladimir), followed by my last name (Feinberg) at Gmail.
