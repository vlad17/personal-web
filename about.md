Hello! After graduating from Princeton with a degree in Computer Science, I became an EECS Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley at the [RISELab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/). I dropped out to work at a startup, [Sisu](http://sisu.ai), where I'm Head of ML. Come [join me](https://jobs.lever.co/sisu/091da572-9c63-469f-963d-cedc64fcfff2?lever-origin=applied&lever-source%5B%5D=Vlad%20Blog).

If you find any typos or incorrect information, I would really appreciate it if you let me know! Please fill in a [GitHub issue form](https://github.com/vlad17/vlad17.github.io/issues/new).

If you want to contact me for some other reason, or don't have a GitHub account, then you can email me. It's my full first name (Vlad is short for Vladimir), followed by my last name (Feinberg) at Gmail.
