I've added [heavy hitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misra%E2%80%93Gries_summary) functionality to the [dsrs](https://github.com/vlad17/datasketches-rs) crate (in addition to a variant of [Count-Min](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count%E2%80%93min_sketch)). It's another streaming algorithm which helps us find the most popular repeated lines in a stream. In this blog post, we'll see how this approximate algorithm saves memory over an exact approach.

For instance, maybe we have access logs which contain IP addresses like so:

```
1.1.1.1
3.1.2.3
1.1.1.1
4.2.1.2
1.1.1.1
```

where there could be millions of unique IP addresses accessing our server, but we'd only be interested in monitoring the ones like `1.1.1.1` that access it most often to check for possible malicious behavior such as a DoS attack. In principle, we could track every single unique IP address and how often it appears in the log, but this'd require as much memory as there are unique IPs. If we're only interested in the top-\\(k \\) IPs by frequency, could we do better?

Indeed, if we're willing to give approximate answers! Sketching approaches have [nuanced guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07001), but generally work well in practice. The `dsrs` library provides an API for the heavy hitters sketch, which accepts a textual stream and returns the *approximate* top-\\(k \\) most popular items in that stream.

Tim Bray has a [tuned Go package](https://github.com/timbray/topfew) which I've installed as `tf` below which answers the *exact* top-\\(k \\) query. Over several blog posts, Tim's package has evolved to be mostly I/O bound. So it'll be tough competition for the approximate approach.

In the experiment below, we seek to answer, what are the 10 most popular of 28 million downloaded [SciHub articles](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.q447c) from September 2015 to February 2016? At 2.6 GB we'll see which approach best answers this question on my laptop!

echo 'will cite' | parallel --citation 1> /dev/null 2> /dev/null 

du -hsc scihub_data/*.tab | tail -1

parallel --pipepart wc -l :::: scihub_data/*.tab \

# hoping that a sketch with only ~10 slots of space can recover the exact top 10 is wishful thinking
# but it really doesn't take that much to get to the top-10. Asking for an *approximate* top-4100
# gets us to the *exact* top-10

In the logs above, we observe the total runtime and memory use in KB for a tuned Go implementation based on a hashmap versus two approximate competitors: approximate top-\\(k \\) and top-\\(M \\), where  \\(M \\) was found via binary search as roughly the smallest constant for which all of the _true_ top-\\(k \\) articles appear.

We notice a couple of things

 - The estimates from the sketch can't be trusted (nor do they ever purport to be that trustworthy). However, a low-memory second pass could be used to recover exact counts for just the heavy hitters selected by the sketch.
 - The approximate approach significantly improves on both runtime and memory usage. Even with the larger  \\(M=4100 \\) necessary to recover the true top-\\(k \\) at  \\(k=10 \\), the approximation was about  \\(2\times \\) faster and used  \\(362\times \\) less memory!

I hope this motivates you to try out [dsrs](https://github.com/vlad17/datasketches-rs) next time you have a lot of logfiles to churn through but don't want to reach for a heavyweight distributed computing solution.
